This project was created as a collaboration between Claire L. Evans and Tracy
Chou for Rhizome's [Seven on Seven](http://sevenonseven.rhizome.org/). The event
was recorded and our presentation can be viewed
[online](http://livestream.com/newmuseum/SevenonSeven2016) starting at 3:39:45.

S.V.S. is a play for four bots, in three acts.

Description of characters:
X1: A pathetic figure.
X2: A tall, distinguished scientist.
X3: A good-looking young AI.
X4: A competent engineer.

The genders, names, and voices of each character are randomly generated
each time S.V.S. is performed.

To start the play, run:
```python read_script.py```
from the base directory.

(Note that this code only works on Mac, and you may need to install voices through System Preferences > Accessibility > Speech > System Voice > Customize... to make it work. To see what voices are used in the script, see ```MALE_VOICES``` and ```FEMALE_VOICES``` in ```read_script.py```.)

Enjoy!
